# BELL

BELL (acronym TBD) is a collection of scripts and functions I want to collect and possibly share.

As of now, each small snippets are distributed in its own directory, with contained documentation and 
example data. We will see in the future if this is shareable or I just use it for bookeeping.

As of _right_ now it is simply a way to share some stuff under version
control, hei Ragnar!

If any comments, please direct them to johbla@ous-hf.no

Sentence for the mac-test - adding for token-purposes

## General overlook

The snippets are put into directories, where there are one main-file
containing functions, and a test-file. With the exception of ROC where
there is only a test file. And the "supp"-directory where there are only
misc. stuff.
