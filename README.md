# BELL

BELL (acronym TBD) is a collection of scripts and functions I want to collect and possibly share.

As of now, each small snippets are distributed in its own directory, with contained documentation and 
example data. We will see in the future if this is shareable or I just use it for bookeeping.

If any comments, please direct them to johbla@ous-hf.no
